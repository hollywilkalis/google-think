# CSS course - week 2 - Think With Google replica

#### The assignment is to create a replica of the Think With Google landing page using HTML, CSS, Javascript and a framework of our choice. December 2017

#### By Holly Wilkalis

## Description

This project recreates an existing page as it existed at the time I started the project. This represents a visual recreation only - functions like form submission and search tools were not recreated at this time.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Using your Terminal or other similar program, navigate to the directory where you want to save the files.
* Run this command to create a local version of the site: $ git clone https://github.com/hollywilkalis/google-think
* Run this command to navigate into the project folder: $ cd google-think
* You can now view, access and edit the project files (including HTML, scripts, and CSS)

A live version of the page can be viewed at http://hollywilkalis.github.io/google-think
